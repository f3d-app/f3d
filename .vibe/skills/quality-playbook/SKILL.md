# Quality Playbook Generator

**When this skill starts, display this banner before doing anything else:**

```
Quality Playbook v1.2.0 — by Andrew Stellman
https://github.com/andrewstellman/
```

Generate a complete quality system tailored to a specific codebase. Unlike test stub generators that work mechanically from source code, this skill explores the project first — understanding its domain, architecture, specifications, and failure history — then produces a quality playbook grounded in what it finds.

## Why This Exists

Most software projects have tests, but few have a quality *system*. Tests check whether code works. A quality system answers harder questions: what does "working correctly" mean for this specific project? What are the ways it could fail that wouldn't be caught by tests? What should every developer (human or AI) know before touching this code?

Without a quality playbook, every new contributor (and every new AI session) starts from scratch — guessing at what matters, writing tests that look good but don't catch real bugs, and rediscovering failure modes that were already found and fixed months ago. A quality playbook makes the bar explicit, persistent, and inherited.

## What This Skill Produces

Six files that together form a repeatable quality system:

| File | Purpose | Why It Matters | Executes Code? |
|------|---------|----------------|----------------|
| `quality/QUALITY.md` | Quality constitution — coverage targets, fitness-to-purpose scenarios, theater prevention | Every AI session reads this first. It tells them what "good enough" means so they don't guess. | No |
| `quality/test_functional.*` | Automated functional tests derived from specifications | The safety net. Tests tied to what the spec says should happen, not just what the code does. Use the project's language: `test_functional.py` (Python), `FunctionalSpec.scala` (Scala), `functional.test.ts` (TypeScript), `FunctionalTest.java` (Java), etc. | **Yes** |
| `quality/RUN_CODE_REVIEW.md` | Code review protocol with guardrails that prevent hallucinated findings | AI code reviews without guardrails produce confident but wrong findings. The guardrails (line numbers, grep before claiming, read bodies) often improve accuracy. | No |
| `quality/RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS.md` | Integration test protocol — end-to-end pipeline across all variants | Unit tests pass, but does the system actually work end-to-end with real external services? | **Yes** |
| `quality/RUN_SPEC_AUDIT.md` | Council of Three multi-model spec audit protocol | No single AI model catches everything. Three independent models with different blind spots catch defects that any one alone would miss. | No |
| `AGENTS.md` | Bootstrap context for any AI session working on this project | The "read this first" file. Without it, AI sessions waste their first hour figuring out what's going on. | No |

Plus output directories: `quality/code_reviews/`, `quality/spec_audits/`, `quality/results/`.

The critical deliverable is the functional test file (named for the project's language and test framework conventions). The Markdown protocols are documentation for humans and AI agents. The functional tests are the automated safety net.

## How to Use

Point this skill at any codebase:

```
Generate a quality playbook for this project.
```

```
Update the functional tests — the quality playbook already exists.
```

```
Run the spec audit protocol.
```

If a quality playbook already exists (`quality/QUALITY.md`, functional tests, etc.), read the existing files first, then evaluate them against the self-check benchmarks in the verification phase. Don't assume existing files are complete — treat them as a starting point.

---

## Phase 1: Explore the Codebase (Do Not Write Yet)

Spend the first phase understanding the project. The quality playbook must be grounded in this specific codebase — not generic advice.

**Why explore first?** The most common failure in AI-generated quality playbooks is producing generic content — coverage targets that could apply to any project, scenarios that describe theoretical failures, tests that exercise language builtins instead of project code. Exploration prevents this by forcing every output to reference something real: a specific function, a specific schema, a specific defensive code pattern. If you can't point to where something lives in the code, you're guessing — and guesses produce quality playbooks nobody trusts.

**Scaling for large codebases:** For projects with more than ~50 source files, don't try to read everything. Focus exploration on the 3–5 core modules (the ones that handle the primary data flow, the most complex logic, and the most failure-prone operations). Read representative tests from each subsystem rather than every test file. The goal is depth on what matters, not breadth across everything.

### Step 0: Ask About Development History

Before exploring code, ask the user one question:

> "Do you have exported AI chat history from developing this project — Claude exports, Gemini takeouts, ChatGPT exports, Claude Code transcripts, or similar? If so, point me to the folder. The design discussions, incident reports, and quality decisions in those chats will make the generated quality playbook significantly better."

If the user provides a chat history folder:

1. **Scan for an index file first.** Look for files named `INDEX*`, `CONTEXT.md`, `README.md`, or similar navigation aids. If one exists, read it — it will tell you what's there and how to find things.
2. **Search for quality-relevant conversations.** Look for messages mentioning: quality, testing, coverage, bugs, failures, incidents, crashes, validation, retry, recovery, spec, fitness, audit, review. Also search for the project name.
3. **Extract design decisions and incident history.** The most valuable content is: (a) incident reports — what went wrong, how many records affected, how it was detected, (b) design discussions — why a particular approach was chosen, what alternatives were rejected, (c) quality framework discussions — coverage targets, testing philosophy, model review experiences, (d) cross-model feedback — where different AI models disagreed about the code.
4. **Don't try to read everything.** Chat histories can be enormous. Use the index to find the most relevant conversations, then search within those for quality-related content. 10 minutes of targeted searching beats 2 hours of exhaustive reading.

This context is gold. A chat history where the developer discussed "why we chose this concurrency model" or "the time we lost 1,693 records in production" transforms generic scenarios into authoritative ones.

If the user doesn't have chat history, proceed normally — the skill works without it, just with less context.

### Step 1: Identify Domain, Stack, and Specifications

Read the README, existing documentation, and build config (`pyproject.toml` / `package.json` / `Cargo.toml`). Answer:

- What does this project do? (One sentence.)
- What language and key dependencies?
- What external systems does it talk to?
- What is the primary output?

**Find the specifications.** Specs are the source of truth for functional tests. Search in order: `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` in root, `specs/`, `docs/`, `spec/`, `design/`, `architecture/`, `adr/`, then `.md` files in root. Record the paths.

**If no formal spec documents exist**, the skill still works — but you need to assemble requirements from other sources. In order of preference:

1. **Ask the user** — they often know the requirements even if they're not written down.
2. **README and inline documentation** — many projects embed requirements in their README, API docs, or code comments.
3. **Existing test suite** — tests are implicit specifications. If a test asserts `process(x) == y`, that's a requirement.
4. **Type signatures and validation rules** — schemas, type annotations, and validators define what the system accepts and rejects.
5. **Infer from code behavior** — as a last resort, read the code and infer what it's supposed to do. Mark these as *inferred requirements* in QUALITY.md and flag them for user confirmation.

When working from non-formal requirements, label each scenario and test with a **requirement tag** that includes a confidence tier and source:

- `[Req: formal — README §3]` — written by humans in a spec document. Authoritative.
- `[Req: user-confirmed — "must handle empty input"]` — stated by the user but not in a formal doc. Treat as authoritative.
- `[Req: inferred — from validate_input() behavior]` — deduced from code. Flag for user review.

Use this exact tag format in QUALITY.md scenarios, functional test documentation, and spec audit findings. It makes clear which requirements are authoritative and which need validation.

### Step 2: Map the Architecture

List source directories and their purposes. Read the main entry point, trace execution flow. Identify:

- The 3–5 major subsystems
- The data flow (Input → Processing → Output)
- The most complex module
- The most fragile module

### Step 3: Read Existing Tests

Read the existing test files — all of them for small/medium projects, or a representative sample from each subsystem for large ones. Identify: test count, coverage patterns, gaps, and any coverage theater (tests that look good but don't catch real bugs).

**Critical: Record the import pattern.** How do existing tests import project modules? Every language has its own conventions (Python `sys.path` manipulation, Java/Scala package imports, TypeScript relative paths or aliases, Go package/module paths, Rust `use crate::` or `use myproject::`). You must use the exact same pattern in your functional tests — getting this wrong means every test fails with import/resolution errors. See `references/functional_tests.md` § "Import Pattern" for the full six-language matrix.

**Identify integration test runners.** Look for scripts or test files that exercise the system end-to-end against real external services (APIs, databases, etc.). Note their patterns — you'll need them for `RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS.md`.

### Step 4: Read the Specifications

Walk each spec document section by section. For every section, ask: "What testable requirement does this state?" Record spec requirements without corresponding tests — these are the gaps the functional tests must close.

If using inferred requirements (from tests, types, or code behavior), tag each with its confidence tier using the `[Req: tier — source]` format defined in Step 1. Inferred requirements feed into QUALITY.md scenarios and should be flagged for user review in Phase 4.

### Step 4b: Read Function Signatures and Real Data

Before writing any test, you must know exactly how each function is called. For every module you identified in Step 2:

1. **Read the actual function signatures** — parameter names, types, defaults. Don't guess from usage context — read the function definition and any documentation (Python docstrings, Java/Scala Javadoc/ScalaDoc, TypeScript type annotations, Go godoc comments, Rust doc comments and type signatures).
2. **Read real data files** — If the project has items files, fixture files, config files, or sample data (in `pipelines/`, `fixtures/`, `test_data/`, `examples/`), read them. Your test fixtures must match the real data shape exactly.
3. **Read existing test fixtures** — How do existing tests create test data? Copy their patterns. If they build config dicts with specific keys, use those exact keys.
4. **Check library versions** — Check the project's dependency manifest (`requirements.txt`, `build.sbt`, `package.json`, `pom.xml`/`build.gradle`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`) to see what's actually available. Don't write tests that depend on library features that aren't installed. If a dependency might be missing, use the test framework's skip mechanism — see `references/functional_tests.md` § "Library version awareness" for framework-specific examples.

Record a **function call map**: for each function you plan to test, write down its name, module, parameters, and what it returns. This map prevents the most common test failure: calling functions with wrong arguments.

### Step 5: Find the Skeletons

This is the most important step. Search for defensive code patterns — each one is evidence of a past failure or known risk.

**Why this matters:** Developers don't write `try/except` blocks, null checks, or retry logic for fun. Every piece of defensive code exists because someone got burned. A `try/except` around a JSON parse means malformed JSON happened in production. A null check on a field means that field was missing when it shouldn't have been. These patterns are the codebase whispering its history of failures. Each one becomes a fitness-to-purpose scenario and a boundary test.

**Read `references/defensive_patterns.md`** for the systematic search approach, grep patterns, and how to convert findings into fitness-to-purpose scenarios and boundary tests.

Minimum bar: at least 2–3 defensive patterns per core source file. If you find fewer, you're skimming — read function bodies, not just signatures.

### Step 5a: Trace State Machines

If the project has any kind of state management — status fields, lifecycle phases, workflow stages, mode flags — trace the state machine completely. This catches a category of bugs that defensive pattern analysis alone misses: states that exist but aren't handled.

**How to find state machines:** Search for status/state fields in models, enums, or constants (e.g., `status`, `state`, `phase`, `mode`). Search for guards that check status before allowing actions (e.g., `if status == "running"`, `match self.state`). Search for state transitions (assignments to status fields).

**For each state machine you find:**

1. **Enumerate all possible states.** Read the enum, the constants, or grep for every value the field is assigned. List them all.
2. **For each consumer of state** (UI handlers, API endpoints, control flow guards), check: does it handle every possible state? A `switch`/`match` without a meaningful default, or an `if/elif` chain that doesn't cover all states, is a gap.
3. **For each state transition**, check: can you reach every state? Are there states you can enter but never leave? Are there states that block operations that should be available?
4. **Record gaps as findings.** A status guard that allows action X for "running" but not for "stuck" is a real bug if the user needs to perform action X on stuck processes. A process that enters a terminal state but never triggers cleanup is a real bug.

**Why this matters:** State machine gaps produce bugs that are invisible during normal operation but surface under stress or edge conditions — exactly when you need the system to work. A batch processor that can't be killed when it's in "stuck" status, or a watcher that never self-terminates after all work completes, or a UI that refuses to resume a "pending" run, are all symptoms of incomplete state handling. These bugs don't show up in defensive pattern analysis because the code isn't defending against them — it's simply not handling them at all.

### Step 5b: Map Schema Types

If the project has a validation layer (Pydantic models in Python, JSON Schema, TypeScript interfaces/Zod schemas, Java Bean Validation annotations, Scala case class codecs), read the schema definitions now. For every field you found a defensive pattern for, record what the schema accepts vs. rejects.

**Read `references/schema_mapping.md`** for the mapping format and why this matters for writing valid boundary tests.

### Step 6: Identify Quality Risks (Code + Domain Knowledge)

Every project has a different failure profile. This step uses **two sources** — not just code exploration, but your training knowledge of what goes wrong in similar systems.

**From code exploration**, ask:
- What does "silently wrong" look like for this project?
- What external dependencies can change without warning?
- What looks simple but is actually complex?
- Where do cross-cutting concerns hide?

**From domain knowledge**, ask:
- "What goes wrong in systems like this?" — If it's a batch processor, think about crash recovery, idempotency, silent data loss, state corruption. If it's a web app, think about auth edge cases, race conditions, input validation bypasses. If it handles randomness or statistics, think about seeding, correlation, distribution bias.
- "What produces correct-looking output that is actually wrong?" — This is the most dangerous class of bug: output that passes all checks but is subtly corrupted.
- "What happens at 10x scale that doesn't happen at 1x?" — Chunk boundaries, rate limits, timeout cascading, memory pressure.
- "What happens when this process is killed at the worst possible moment?" — Mid-write, mid-transaction, mid-batch-submission.
- "What information does the user need before committing to an irreversible or expensive operation?" — Pre-run cost estimates, confirmation of scope (especially when fan-out or expansion will multiply the work), resource warnings. If the system can silently commit the user to hours of processing or significant cost without showing them what they're about to do, that's a missing safeguard. Search for operations that start long-running processes, submit batch jobs, or trigger expansion/fan-out — and check whether the user sees a preview, estimate, or confirmation with real numbers before the point of no return.
- "What happens when a long-running process finishes — does it actually stop?" — Polling loops, watchers, background threads, and daemon processes that run until completion should have explicit termination conditions. If the loop checks "is there more work?" but never checks "is all work done?", it will run forever after completion. This is especially common in batch processors and queue consumers.

Generate realistic failure scenarios from this knowledge. You don't need to have observed these failures — you know from training that they happen to systems of this type. Write them as **architectural vulnerability analyses** with specific quantities and consequences. Frame each as "this architecture permits the following failure mode" — not as a fabricated incident report. Use concrete numbers to make the severity non-negotiable: "If the process crashes mid-write during a 10,000-record batch, `save_state()` without an atomic rename pattern will leave a corrupted state file — the next run gets JSONDecodeError and cannot resume without manual intervention." Then ground them in the actual code you explored: "Read persistence.py line ~340 (save_state): verify temp file + rename pattern."

## Phase 2: Generate the Quality Playbook

Now write the six files. For each one, follow the structure below and consult the relevant reference file for detailed guidance.

**Why six files instead of just tests?** Tests catch regressions but don't prevent new categories of bugs. The quality constitution (`QUALITY.md`) tells future sessions what "correct" means before they start writing code. The protocols (`RUN_*.md`) provide structured processes for review, integration testing, and spec auditing that produce repeatable results — instead of leaving quality to whatever the AI feels like checking. Together, these files create a quality system where each piece reinforces the others: scenarios in QUALITY.md map to tests in the functional test file, which are verified by the integration protocol, which is audited by the Council of Three.

### File 1: `quality/QUALITY.md` — Quality Constitution

**Read `references/constitution.md`** for the full template and examples.

The constitution has six sections:

1. **Purpose** — What quality means for this project, grounded in Deming (built in, not inspected), Juran (fitness for use), Crosby (quality is free). Apply these specifically: what does "fitness for use" mean for *this system*? Not "tests pass" but the actual operational requirement.
2. **Coverage Targets** — Table mapping each subsystem to a target with rationale referencing real risks. Every target must have a "why" grounded in a specific scenario — without it, a future AI session will argue the target down.
3. **Coverage Theater Prevention** — Project-specific examples of fake tests, derived from what you saw during exploration.
4. **Fitness-to-Purpose Scenarios** — The heart of it. Each scenario documents a realistic failure mode with code references and verification method. Aim for 2+ scenarios per core module — typically 8–10 total for a medium project.
5. **AI Session Quality Discipline** — Rules every AI session must follow
6. **The Human Gate** — Things requiring human judgment

**Scenario voice is critical.** Write "What happened" as architectural vulnerability analyses with specific quantities, cascade consequences, and detection difficulty — not as abstract specifications.

Every scenario's "How to verify" must map to at least one test in the functional test file.

### File 2: Functional Tests

**This is the most important deliverable.** Read `references/functional_tests.md` for the complete guide.

Organize the tests into three logical groups:

- **Spec requirements** — One test per testable spec section. Each test's documentation cites the spec requirement it verifies.
- **Fitness scenarios** — One test per QUALITY.md scenario. 1:1 mapping, named to match.
- **Boundaries and edge cases** — One test per defensive pattern from Step 5.

Key rules:
- **Match the existing import pattern exactly.**
- **Read every function's signature before calling it.**
- **No placeholder tests.**
- **Test count heuristic** = (testable spec sections) + (QUALITY.md scenarios) + (defensive patterns).
- **Cross-variant heuristic: ~30%**
- **Test outcomes, not mechanisms**
- **Use schema-valid mutations**

### File 3: `quality/RUN_CODE_REVIEW.md`

**Read `references/review_protocols.md`** for the template.

Key sections: bootstrap files, focus areas mapped to architecture, and these mandatory guardrails:
- Line numbers are mandatory — no line number, no finding
- Read function bodies, not just signatures
- If unsure: flag as QUESTION, not BUG
- Grep before claiming missing
- Do NOT suggest style changes — only flag things that are incorrect

**Phase 2: Regression tests.** After the review produces BUG findings, write regression tests in `quality/test_regression.*` that reproduce each bug.

### File 4: `quality/RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS.md`

**Read `references/review_protocols.md`** for the template.

Must include: safety constraints, pre-flight checks, test matrix with specific pass criteria, an execution UX section, and a structured reporting format. Cover happy path, cross-variant consistency, output correctness, and component boundaries.

**All commands must use relative paths.**

**Build a Field Reference Table before writing quality gates.** Re-read each schema file IMMEDIATELY before writing each table row. Copy field names character-for-character from the file contents.

### File 5: `quality/RUN_SPEC_AUDIT.md` — Council of Three

**Read `references/spec_audit.md`** for the full protocol.

Three independent AI models audit the code against specifications. The protocol defines: a copy-pasteable audit prompt with guardrails, project-specific scrutiny areas, a triage process, and fix execution rules.

### File 6: `AGENTS.md`

If `AGENTS.md` already exists, update it — don't replace it. Add a Quality Docs section pointing to all generated files.

---

## Phase 3: Verify

**Read `references/verification.md`** for the complete checklist.

The critical checks:

1. **Test count** near heuristic target
2. **Scenario coverage** — scenario test count matches QUALITY.md scenario count
3. **Cross-variant coverage** — ~30% of tests parametrize across all input variants
4. **Boundary test count** ≈ defensive pattern count from Step 5
5. **Assertion depth** — Majority of assertions check values, not just presence
6. **Layer correctness** — Tests assert outcomes, not mechanisms
7. **Mutation validity** — Every fixture mutation uses a schema-valid value from Step 5b
8. **All tests pass — zero failures AND zero errors.**
9. **Existing tests unbroken**
10. **Integration test quality gates were written from a Field Reference Table.**

If any benchmark fails, go back and fix it before proceeding.

---

## Phase 4: Present, Explore, Improve (Interactive)

After generating and verifying, present the results clearly and give the user control over what happens next.

### Part 1: The Summary Table

Present a single table the user can scan in 10 seconds:

```
Here's what I generated:

| File | What It Does | Key Metric | Confidence |
|------|-------------|------------|------------|
| QUALITY.md | Quality constitution | 10 scenarios | ██████░░ High — grounded in code, but scenarios are inferred, not from real incidents |
| Functional tests | Automated tests | 47 passing | ████████ High — all tests pass, 35% cross-variant |
| RUN_CODE_REVIEW.md | Code review protocol | 8 focus areas | ████████ High — derived from architecture |
| RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS.md | Integration test protocol | 9 runs × 3 providers | ██████░░ Medium — quality gates need threshold tuning |
| RUN_SPEC_AUDIT.md | Council of Three audit | 10 scrutiny areas | ████████ High — guardrails included |
| AGENTS.md | AI session bootstrap | Updated | ████████ High — factual |
```

After the table, add a "Quick Start" block with ready-to-copy prompts for executing each artifact. After the Quick Start block, add one line:

> "You can ask me about any of these to see the details — for example, 'show me Scenario 3' or 'walk me through the integration test matrix.'"

### Part 2: Drill-Down on Demand

When the user asks about a specific item, give a focused summary — not the whole file, but the key decisions and what you're uncertain about.

### Part 3: The Improvement Menu

After the user has seen the summary, present the improvement options:

> "Three ways to make this better:"
>
> **1. Review and harden individual items**
> **2. Guided Q&A** — I'll ask you 3-5 targeted questions about things I couldn't infer from the code
> **3. Review development history** — Point me to exported AI chat history

The user can cycle through these paths as many times as they want.

---

## Fixture Strategy

The `quality/` folder is separate from the project's unit test folder. Create the appropriate test setup for the project's language:

- **Python:** `quality/conftest.py` for pytest fixtures.
- **Java:** A test class with `@BeforeEach`/`@BeforeAll` setup methods.
- **Scala:** A trait mixed into test specs.
- **TypeScript/JavaScript:** A `quality/setup.ts` with `beforeAll`/`beforeEach` hooks.
- **Go:** Helper functions in the same `_test.go` file. Use `t.Helper()` for test helpers.
- **Rust:** Helper functions in a `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` block.
- **C++:** A `quality/FunctionalTests.cpp` with test fixtures using the project's test framework (e.g., Boost.Test or Google Test).

Examine existing test files to understand how they set up test data. Whatever pattern the existing tests use, copy it.

---

## Terminology

- **Functional testing** — Does the code produce the output specs say it should? Distinct from unit testing.
- **Integration testing** — Do components work together end-to-end, including real external services?
- **Spec audit** — AI models read code and compare against specs. No code executed.
- **Coverage theater** — Tests that produce high coverage numbers but don't catch real bugs.
- **Fitness-to-purpose** — Does the code do what it's supposed to do under real-world conditions?

---

## Principles

1. Fitness-to-purpose over coverage percentages
2. Scenarios come from code exploration AND domain knowledge
3. Concrete failure modes make standards non-negotiable — abstract requirements invite rationalization
4. Guardrails transform AI review quality (line numbers, read bodies, grep before claiming)
5. Triage before fixing — many "defects" are spec bugs or design decisions

---

## Reference Files

Read these as you work through each phase:

| File | When to Read | Contains |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `references/defensive_patterns.md` | Step 5 (finding skeletons) | Grep patterns, how to convert findings to scenarios |
| `references/schema_mapping.md` | Step 5b (schema types) | Field mapping format, mutation validity rules |
| `references/constitution.md` | File 1 (QUALITY.md) | Full template with section-by-section guidance |
| `references/functional_tests.md` | File 2 (functional tests) | Test structure, anti-patterns, cross-variant strategy |
| `references/review_protocols.md` | Files 3–4 (code review, integration) | Templates for both protocols |
| `references/spec_audit.md` | File 5 (Council of Three) | Full audit protocol, triage process, fix execution |
| `references/verification.md` | Phase 3 (verify) | Complete self-check checklist with all 13 benchmarks |
