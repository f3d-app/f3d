# F3D - Fast and minimalist 3D viewer
By Michael Migliore and Mathieu Westphal.

F3D (pronounced `/f…õd/`) is a fast and minimalist 3D viewer desktop application. It supports many file formats, from digital content to scientific datasets (including glTF, USD, STL, STEP, PLY, OBJ, FBX, Alembic), can show animations and support thumbnails and many rendering and texturing options including real time physically based rendering and raytracing.

It is fully controllable from the command line and support configuration files. It can provide thumbnails, support interactive hotkeys, drag&drop and integration into file managers.

F3D also contains the libf3d, a simple library to render meshes, with C++ and Python Bindings, as well as experimental Java and Javascript bindings.

# Quickstart

Open a file and visualize it interactively:

```
f3d /path/to/file.ext
```

Open a file and save the rendering into an image file:

```
f3d /path/to/file.ext --output=/path/to/img.png
```

Get help:

```
f3d --help
man f3d # Linux only
```
