#
#   f3d::f3d           Target that contains the F3D executable
#
#   f3d::libf3d        Target that contains the libf3d
#
# The following local variables will also be defined:
#
#   f3d_INCLUDE_DIR        Path to the include directory of public f3d library classes
#
#   f3d_MODULE_EXTERNAL_RENDERING  Will be enabled if F3D was built with external rendering support
#   f3d_MODULE_RAYTRACING          Will be enabled if F3D was built with raytracing support
#   f3d_BINDINGS_PYTHON            Will be enabled if F3D was built with python bindings
#   f3d_SDK_PLUGIN                 Will be enabled if F3D plugin SDK is available
