# Roadmaps and release cycles

F3D is a community driven project and we try to provide as much information as we can about the upcoming features
and release expectations. Please keep in mind while we may try to fulfill what was planned, some features may not be available
as planned and releases can be delayed.

Roadmaps are available on their dedicated issue with their associated project board and milestone.
They are bound to evolve over time.

If you want to get involved, please feel free to comment on the issues and contribute to the issues that matters to you!
