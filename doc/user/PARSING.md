# Parsing options

When setting options from the [CLI Options](OPTIONS.md), the [commands](COMMANDS.md) or using the [libf3d options string API](../libf3d/OPTIONS.md#string-api), the values are parsed according to their type. If parsing fails, the value is not changed.

The following types are supported:
 - bool: A boolean, true or false.
 - int: A signed integer.
 - double: A floating point number.
 - ratio: A double dividend over a double divisor, stored in a double.
 - string: A string of characters.

As well as a list for each of these types,Â noted as
 - vector\<type\>

## Bool

The following formats are supported when parsing a bool, case insensitive:
 - true/false
 - yes/no
 - on/off
 - 1/0

When formatting a bool into a string, true/false is used.

## Int

Int parsing is supported using [std::stoi](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/stol) and check
that the whole string is parsed.

When formatting an int into a string, [std::to_string](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/to_string) is used.

## Double

Double parsing is supported using [std::stod](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/stol) and check
that the whole string is parsed.

When formatting a double into a string, [std::ostringstream](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_ostringstream) is used
with removing the point and precision when the value is exactly an integer.

## Ratio

The following formats are supported when parsing a string into a ratio:
 - percent% where percent is a double
 - dividend:divisor where both are doubles
 - dividend/divisor where both are doubles
 - double

Percent, dividend, divisor are then parsed as double.

When formatting a ratio into a string, it is formatted as a double.

## String

String are parsed and formatted as is.

## Vectors

Vector tokens are separated by `,`, tokens are then parsed using their respective types.

When formatting a vector into a string, individual token are formatted according to their type and separated using `,`.
