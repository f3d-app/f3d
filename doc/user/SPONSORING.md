# Sponsoring

## Sponsors

F3D, a fast and minimalist 3D viewer is at heart a passion project. We (Michael and myself, Mathieu) created it in order to create the best 3D viewer that we ourselves _want_ to use.

I'm very active in the open source world. I'm employed at Kitware (creator of CMake, VTK and ParaView) and work on VTK and ParaView everyday, while also working on F3D when I have any free time! I love software design and the software process.

Michael is a veteran of the rendering and simulation industry. We met at Kitware and decided to start working on F3D together. He is the expert in all things rendering in F3D, and then some.

We are trying to find some sponsors for F3D in order to cover some of the expenses that it incurs.

For starters, we rely on github infrastructure, which has some costs, even for open source, especially in regard to LFS data, costs that scale with the popularity of the project.
Second, we now have a great website, [f3d.app](https://f3d.app), relying on github pages. We do pay for a domain name and we would like to cover that as well.

If we have enough sponsors, we can consider buying more hardware to develop for and test with, especially Linux mobile and android.
We also want to promote F3D in open source conferences and summits, being able to do that would be great!

Finally, we want to give back to the open source world, either by sponsoring projects that F3D rely on or even by donating to open source developers that contribute their time to the project.

By sponsoring F3D you get a few perks!

First you get access to a dedicated discord channel where F3D devs will answer any questions you may have.
Second, if you sponsor at least 5$/month, you also get to vote for which issue should be implemented/fixed each month.
By sponsoring 20$/month, you also get to pick an image to add to our [gallery](https://f3d.app/doc/GALLERY.html) to showcase your work!

And of course if anyone would like to buy us a beer and talk about F3D then we would be happy to meet up in Lyon, France! Just reach out to us on our [discord](https://discord.f3d.app)!

Please note everything you sponsor gets through the F3D-APP foundation, a non-profit entity we created for this purpose.
