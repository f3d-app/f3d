F3D is a fast and minimalist 3D viewer. Implemented in C++, it has been cross-compiled with emscripten to a WebAssembly module.

While the webassembly module might be quite large (~14MB), it is self contained and requires no external dependency.

# Usage 
```javascript
import f3d from 'f3d'

f3d(settings) // todo
```
